Hyper-V, now ~~safer~~ easier from the Web

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
- This project is **highly unstable**.
- You will almost certainly encounter bugs and various issues. Any problems caused to your VM by using this project are **not the responsibility of this project**.
- I am a **student developer**, so I don‚Äôt have much time to maintain this project.

- This project has **only been tested** on Korean and English versions of **Windows 11 Pro for Workstation**, **Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC** and **Windows Server 2025**.

   The code was also written with reference to **Windows 11 & Windows Server 2025** documentation.

This project **requires PowerShell 7**.

The user must be a member of the **Hyper-V Administrators group**.

Otherwise, it will not function properly.

# Todo

## Must Do

- [ ] VM Actions
- [ ] VM Settings  
- [ ] Admin Page

## Lower Priority, but will be done sooner than below

- [ ] Create VM

## Possible, but very far in the future

- [ ] Download ISO via direct link  
- [ ] Support for [Enhanced-GPU-PV](https://github.com/timminator/Enhanced-GPU-PV)

## No Plans

- [ ] [IronRDP](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP)  
- [ ] Checkpoints  
- [ ] Export VM

I have a lot to say about IronRDP.

I fully support the Rust ecosystem. However, I lack knowledge of Rust, so **porting IronRDP is difficult** for me.

As a result, **RDP functionality will likely not be implemented**.
